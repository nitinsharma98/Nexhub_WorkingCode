Future Scopes ==>
1. Adding Search bar
2. One to one Chats
3. Download full code folders (idea of storing folders)
4. Direct files upload like pic with cloudinary
--
1. Copy btn for codes
2. More Documentation added b website + add more base codes and data 
3. Scrolling more than one images for code posts



Replication work ==> 
1. Delete comments , posts - same as reviews  
2. All work also by Community - if(req.user || Nexhub_Official) 
3. Alert and other styling
4. Scanner is connected same like as Show specific post 




Issues ==>  (less styling capability)
1. Navbar of homepage and headerbar of small screen not shown at once in good way
2. Somewhere click outside to hide shown components like coments , headerbar ---- logout by gpt
3. App.jsx comment alert again in some cases
----
1. Due to less time i give some where default where image already exists so sometimes we can not able to see pic in future i will solve it 
2. After signup always navigate directly not req login  ,   after any submission go to the page to see that.




Run Commands ==> 
    Backend - nodemon app.js
    Frontend- npm run dev
